# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic direction and planned improvements for the x157.github.io project.

## Immediate Tasks
- [ ] **Decouple from `xist.gg`**: Ensure this site operates independently and does not link to `xist.gg` as a mirror.
- [ ] **Site Reorganization**: Improve content structure for better discoverability.
- [ ] **Search**: Implement site-wide search functionality.

## Future Plans
- [ ] **Privacy Agent**: Create a specialized agent to manage privacy policy updates and ensure compliance.
    - *Goal*: Regenerate privacy page automatically based on current practices.
- [ ] **URL Management Integration**:
    - *Goal*: **ALWAYS** keep a full history of URL moves and maps from old to new URL.
    - *Mechanism*: Implement automated tracking of all file moves to update `redirect_from` frontmatter or a central redirect map.

## Ongoing Maintenance
- Maintain backward compatibility for all links.
- Monitor Google Analytics for traffic patterns.
