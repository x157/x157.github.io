# Agent Rules & Guidelines

This document contains rules and guidelines for AI Agents working on the `x157.github.io` project.

## URL Standards
- **Clean URLs**: Do **NOT** create URLs with file extensions (e.g., `/foo.html`). Always use the clean path (e.g., `/foo`).
    - Jekyll will automatically handle the resolution of `foo.md` or `foo.html` to `/foo` in the build process (permalinks).
    - When linking to internal pages, always use the clean URL format.

## Content Management
- **Backward Compatibility**: Always ensure legacy URLs redirect to new locations.
- **Privacy**: Do not add tracking scripts beyond the approved Google Analytics configuration.
