# UE5 Core Library

I'm not going to bother documenting much about the Core library,
but some things I have found to be non-obvious or otherwise interesting
regarding UE5 Core are worth thinking about:

- [FName](./FName) supports optional instance Numbers
- [TMap](./TMap) gracefully handles hash collisions
