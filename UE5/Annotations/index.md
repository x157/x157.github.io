# Unreal Engine Annotations

Epic likes to produce Video Documentation, which is difficult to search.

In an effort to better understand the video content and to help you digest it faster,
I present my Annotations:

- [Version Control Fundamentals \| Live from HQ \| Inside Unreal](Inside-Unreal/EpicGames-Version-Control-Fundamentals) (2020)

Videos already Annotated on YouTube:

- [Tools and Infrastructure for Large Teams \| Unreal Dev Days 2019 \| Unreal Engine](https://youtu.be/d6lyAI4Ftkw)
- [Workflow on Fortnite \| Unreal Fest Europe 2019 \| Unreal Engine](https://youtu.be/p4RcDpGQ_tI)
