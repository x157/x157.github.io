# How to use Perforce on Linux

As I prefer to use Debian (and/or Ubuntu), and as Perforce only distributes Ubuntu `.deb` packages,
this documentation relates to installing p4 on Ubuntu.

Contents:

- [Installing p4 on Ubuntu Linux](#install)
- [Upgrading p4 on Ubuntu Linux](#upgrade)
  - [How to fix expired Perforce Packaging key](#fix-expired-key)
- [How to p4 sync a stream (`git clone` equivalent)](#sync-stream)
- [See Also](#see-also)

NOTE: If you're trying to install a `p4d` server, see the
[Xist.GG Docker: Perforce Server for Unreal Engine](https://github.com/XistGG/docker-perforce-server-for-unreal-engine)
repository, which contains complete setup info for an Ubuntu server.
The commands described below only consider installing the `p4` client.

## Installing p4 on Ubuntu Linux

To install `p4` (command-line utilities) on Ubuntu:

```bash
# Get OS package info (works on Ubuntu and Debian)
# Extract the "VERSION_CODENAME=bookworm"
source /etc/os-release

[ "x$VERSION_CODENAME" = "x" ] && echo "ERROR: OS INFO UNKNOWN" 1>&2

# Download and save the current version of the Perforce public key to local keyring
wget -qO - https://package.perforce.com/perforce.pubkey \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/perforce.gpg

# Add official perforce package source to local sources list
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/perforce.gpg] https://package.perforce.com/apt/ubuntu $VERSION_CODENAME release" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/perforce.list > /dev/null

# Update sources
sudo apt-get -y update

# CHECK FOR ERRORS HERE

# Install "helix-cli" package (p4 client tools)
sudo apt-get -y install helix-cli
```

### Error Checking on `apt-get -y update`

Note that NOT ALL distributions are supported by Perforce.

If you see errors like this in your `apt-get -y update` output,
it means that Perforce does not have a binary distribution for your
OS distribution:

```text
E: The repository 'https://package.perforce.com/apt/ubuntu bookworm Release' does not have a Release file.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.
```

In this case, your `$VERSION_CODENAME` refers to an unsupported release.

What you need to do is try to install a package for a different distribution,
preferably the most recent one for your OS that is actually supported.

For more information see [Perforce Packages](https://help.perforce.com/helix-core/extras/packages/perforce-packages.html)
and the [official list of supported OS Distributions](https://package.perforce.com/apt/ubuntu/dists/).

In my case as of March 2025, `debian` `bookworm` is not supported,
so I instead installed `debian` `jammy` which is a recent, compatible distribution.

#### Recovering from an Error

```bash
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/perforce.list

# Set this to whatever OS distro you explicitly want to use
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/perforce.gpg] https://package.perforce.com/apt/ubuntu $VERSION_CODENAME release" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/perforce.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get -y update

sudo apt-get -y install helix-cli
```


<a id='upgrade'></a>
## Upgrading p4 on Ubuntu Linux

At any point in the future, you can update `p4` by running these commands:

```bash
# Update package versions
sudo apt-get -y update

# Upgrade helix-cli and its dependencies
sudo apt-get -y install helix-cli
```

<a id='fix-expired-key'></a>
### How to fix expired Perforce Packaging key

The Perforce packaging key (`/usr/share/keyrings/perforce.gpg`)
expired on August 14, 2023 UTC.
It will expire again on **June 11, 2026** UTC.

Whenever it expires, you need to get the new version of the key from Perforce,
then update your package sources.

```bash
# Download and save the current version of the Perforce public key to local keyring
wget -qO - https://package.perforce.com/perforce.pubkey \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/perforce.gpg

# Update package versions
sudo apt-get -y update
```

After running the above commands, you should once again be able to upgrade the `helix-cli` package.


<a id='sync-stream'></a>
## How to p4 sync a stream (`git clone` equivalent)

So you are ready to start working on your team's p4 stream!  Very exciting.

### Set up your p4 environment variables

I recommend doing this in your `~/.bash_profile` so it happens automatically every time you start a shell.

```bash
# configure this to be your team's p4d server (ask your lead)
export P4PORT="p4.your-company.com:1666"

# set this to your p4 username (we default to your Linux username)
export P4USER=`whoami`

# Name this based on your team's naming conventions
# At Xist.GG we use "project_user" with an optional "_host" at the end
export P4CLIENT="MyProject_$P4USER"
```

### Create an new project workspace

You need to have your p4 environment set up to do this.

```bash
# Set this to whatever stream you want to work on (ask your lead)
MY_P4_STREAM="//My/Stream"

# Use whatever directory you prefer on your local workstation
MY_WORKSPACE_DIR="$HOME/dev/MyProject"

# Create the directory
mkdir -p $MY_WORKSPACE_DIR

# Login to the p4 server
p4 login

# Create a workspace on the server mapping to this directory
p4 client -i <<__EOF
Client: $P4CLIENT
Root: $MY_WORKSPACE_DIR
Stream: $MY_P4_STREAM
Owner: $P4USER
Host: `hostname`
__EOF
```

### Sync the stream from the p4 server

You need to have your p4 environment set up to do this.

```bash
# cd to your workspace dir and sync files
cd $MY_WORKSPACE_DIR
p4 sync ... | tee .p4sync.txt
```

Once you start the `p4 sync ...` it might consume your network for a while, you're now downloading the entire stream.

Leave that terminal alone until it finishes syncing.
