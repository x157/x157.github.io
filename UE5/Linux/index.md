# Linux UE5 Dev Notes

- [How to use Perforce on Linux](/UE5/Linux/p4) covers installation and basic usage

## Setting up a build machine

- Create a `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Minimal` VM on Google Compute
  - Need at least 200 GB disk
  - Ideally at least 16 physical cores (more builds faster but is more expensive)

### Install prerequisite packages

```bash
# You need some Ubuntu packages installed before you do anything else
sudo apt-get -y update

sudo apt-get -y install \
  autoconf \
  binutils \
  bison \
  build-essential \
  bzip2 \
  cmake \
  flex \
  gettext \
  gcc \
  git \
  help2man \
  libncurses-dev \
  libtool libtool-bin libtool-doc \
  lsb-core \
  texinfo \
  zip

# These packages seem to be needed for UnrealVersionSelector at least
sudo apt-get -y install xdg-user-dirs xdg-utils
```

### Install packages required to cook

Games will build without these, but you cannot Cook without these (UE 5.6):

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install \
  libasound2 \
  libgbm-dev
```


### Install PowerShell for UnrealXistTools

If you're using [UnrealXistTools](/UnrealXistTools/), you need to install PowerShell.

Check this official Microsoft documentation:
[Installing PowerShell on Ubuntu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-ubuntu#installation-via-package-repository-the-package-repository)

TLDR you need to run 8-10 commands, you can mostly cut/paste from that page.

## Get Engine Source

Either `git clone` the Engine source, or
[install p4](/UE5/Linux/p4) and sync your Engine stream.

## Run `./Setup.sh`

If you cloned git, then run `./Setup.sh` from the repo clone just as
you would on any other OS.

This is fairly easy and after it completes you can skip to
[Generate Project Files](#GenerateProjectFiles) below.

If your Engine source is derived from UDN P4 rather than Github,
then instead of `./Setup.sh` (which doesn't exist), the process is
slightly more complex.  Keep reading.

### `./Setup.sh` for P4-based Engine source

```bash
# cd into Linux-specific Build BatchFiles
pushd Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux

# Run Linux-specific SetupToolchain.sh
./SetupToolchain.sh

# Build third party libs if needed
./BuildThirdParty.sh

popd
```

## Generate Project Files

However you go about running your `./Setup.sh`, afterward you need to
Generate Project Files.

```bash
# Generate project files (AFTER Setup completed successfully)
./GenerateProjectFiles.sh
```

## Building the Project

In this example we're building the `LyraEditor` target in the `Development` configuration:

```bash
# Change these based on what you want to build
Target="LyraEditor"  # prefix of the "*.Target.cs" to build
Platform="Linux"  # always Linux on Linux
Configuration="Development"  # or "DebugGame" or "Shipping" etc

# cd to your Engine's root dir
./RunUBT.sh $Target $Platform $Configuration
```

Given this is Linux, you probably want to build `LyraServerEOS`, right?  `:)`


## Building UnrealVersionSelector

To rebuild `UnrealVersionSelector` for Linux, run this command:

```bash
# Rebuild UnrealVersionSelector
./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/Build.sh UnrealVersionSelector Linux Shipping
```

This generates `Engine/Binaries/Linux/UnrealVersionSelector-Linux-Shipping`

### Register your Custom Engine

After building `UnrealVersionSelector`, run:

```bash
# Register this custom UE version on the current host
./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UnrealVersionSelector-Linux-Shipping -register -unattended
```

After running that, you can look in the Linux custom engine registry to find your engine listed:

```bash
cat $HOME/.config/Epic/UnrealEngine/Install.ini
```

The output looks something like this:

```ini
[Installations]
148492FA-37EF-4C22-AA40-9C709BBEB08F=/opt/UE_5.5
```

If you need to coordinate custom engine names with your team, you can add
a custom name for your engine, like:

```ini
[Installations]
148492FA-37EF-4C22-AA40-9C709BBEB08F=/opt/UE_5.5
MyCustomEngine=/opt/UE_5.5
```

This will allow you to use `EngineAssociation = "MyCustomEngine"`
in your `.uproject` file, assuming everyone on your team does this.

See [UEngine.ps1](https://github.com/XistGG/UnrealXistTools?tab=readme-ov-file#uengineps1)
in [UnrealXistTools](https://github.com/XistGG/UnrealXistTools)
for a fully cross-platform PowerShell script to make custom engine management easier.
