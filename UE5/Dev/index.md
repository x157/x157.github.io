# Development in UE5

There is a TON to learn to become a better UE5 C++ Developer.  I've tried to organize some of
the huge number of topics you'll need to know so you can peruse them and see what might
interest you to learn first.

When you first start working in UE5 it can feel overwhelming as you literally know NOTHING,
and EVERY SINGLE THING mentioned is new and unknown, so piecing together the knowledge
puzzle can feel difficult.

Welcome to being a Human.  I find that breaking it into pieces and trying to learn just a
small piece at a time can help to speed learning and increase the frequency of dopamine shots you get
each time you have an epiphany.


## Getting Started

If you're brand new to Unreal in general:

Specific to C++:

- Unreal Community Wiki: [Learn Unreal C++](https://unrealcommunity.wiki/unreal-cpp-d702003t)
- [Unreal Engine C++ Complete Guide](https://www.tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-cpp-guide/) by Tom Looman


#### Choose/Install Developer Tools

- [IDE Options](./IDE) - choosing the right IDE will save you time (`time == $`)
- [Source Control](./Source-Control) - Git or Perforce?

If you are a Windows user, see my notes and tips regarding
[Development on Windows](/Windows/).
