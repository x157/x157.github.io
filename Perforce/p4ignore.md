# Perforce `.p4ignore`

This example is for a UE 5.1
[Lyra](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/) project.

You need to put a file like this in your project root folder, named `.p4ignore`.
Edit as needed.


```text
# Here you can specify files to ignore when adding files to the depot.
#
# The syntax for P4IGNORE files is not the same as Perforce syntax.
# Instead, it is similar to that used by other versioning systems:
#
# - Files are specified in local syntax
# - a # character at the beginning of a line denotes a comment
# - a ! character at the beginning of a line excludes the file specification
# - a * wildcard matches substrings.
#
# For example:
#
# foo.txt    Ignore files called "foo.txt"
# *.exe      Ignore all executables
# !bar.exe   Exclude bar.exe from being ignored
