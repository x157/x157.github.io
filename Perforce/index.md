To best support non-technical members of the Xist.GG team,
I require the binary locking/sharing capabilities of Perforce.


## How To: Set up a UE5 Perforce Server

Before you create any depots on your P4 server, set up the `typemap` and `.p4ignore`.

1. [Set up Perforce Typemap](./Typemap)
2. [Create `.p4ignore`](./p4ignore)

Once you have these, create any depots you need.
For example you could create depots like:

- [Lyra Project Source Depot](#LyraProjectSourceDepot)
- [Custom UE5 Engine Source Depot](#CustomUE5EngineSourceDepot)

## How To: Set up a Lyra Project Source Depot

1. [Create `//Lyra` Depot](./How-to-Create-Lyra-Depot)
2. [Create `//Lyra/Main` Stream](./How-to-Create-Lyra-Main-Stream) (import from Epic `#NoChanges`)
3. [Create `//Lyra/Xist` Stream](./How-to-Create-Lyra-Xist-Stream) (apply `LYRAGAME_API` updates, `virtual` overrides, etc)


## How To: Create a new `//Lyra/Xist`-based Game Project

1. [Create a new `//Lyra/XistGame` Stream](./How-to-Create-Lyra-Xist-Game-Stream) based on `//Lyra/Xist`
   - Repeat as needed with each new stream/project name


## How To: Merge Epic Updates into a Lyra P4 Depot

See [this detailed PowerShell procedure](/UE5/LyraStarterGame/Tutorials/Procedure-Merge-Epic-Source-into-Perforce)
for the exact commands necessary to merge new updates from Epic into an existing
Lyra Project P4 depot.

## How To: Set up a Custom UE5 Engine Source Depot

1. Create Depot `//UE5`
2. Create Mainline Stream `//UE5/Release`
  - Import Epic Custom Engine Source from either GitHub or UDN P4
3. Create Task Stream `//UE5/Xist` with parent `//UE5/Release`
  - Apply Xist hacks/edits to this custom 5.1 engine
